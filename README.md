# sdl2gfx-builds

This repository contains a set of build scripts for generating up-to-date release binaries for the [SDL2_gfx](http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/) library using Appveyor, avoiding the need to compile them yourself.

Windows (32-bit & 64-bit) and macOS (10.6+, 64-bit) are currently supported. Current builds of SDL2_gfx for all supported platforms are available from the project's [releases page](https://github.com/a-hurst/sdl2gfx-builds/releases).
